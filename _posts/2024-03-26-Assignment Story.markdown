## Introduction <br>
In this part of our research we will find the relation between hapiness and GDP. Moreover, we will find if there is any other link between hapiness score with other variable like social benifit, healthy life expectancy for find the relationship. We use the dataset of world happiness report [1].The dataset includes information from 171 different countries and is categorized into 11 distinct regions.
## Story
It's essential to recognize the elements that fundamentally contribute to happiness in a world where progress and improved living standards are being searched for. The complicated relationship between economic prosperity and emotional well-being is highlighted by recent research on global happiness statistics, which shows how these factors connect globally.

>We tried to capture a holistic view from this paper, and since Sanfransisoc is a city in California, this paper (systematically structured valid information source )will help us to evaluate our ideas.

 The rise in the purchase of legal firearms and the subsequent increase in crime gun recoveries with short TTCs might be linked to the initial surge in assaults depicted in the graph (image 1).

According to our dataset, the map depicts that throughout the study period, 'BAYVIEW' had the most crime related to 'Weapon Law,' with 4079 crime records. On the other hand, 'RICHMOND,' which had only 691 records, would be the best place to avoid such crimes in San Fransisco (image 2).

The chart shows two trends in crime over a typical day in the city from 2010 to 2017. Assaults are less frequent than weapon law violations, and both types of crime are least likely to occur in the early morning, around 4 to 6 AM. As the day progresses, the examples of both crimes grow, with a significant wave in weapon-related crimes beginning late in the morning. The peak for assault and weapon law violations happens in the evening, between 6 PM and 9 PM. After this peak, the crimes gradually decrease as the night progresses. We can see a clear connection between 'Weapon Law' and 'Assult' related crimes.
 
This data can provide insights into the times of day most prone to criminal activities and may help law enforcement in crime prevention and resource allocation.
 
>We speculate that the weapons law in the USA has to be reformed to ensure a significant decrease in crimes related to firearms and assault. The number of weapons sold in the USA has increased rapidly.[2]
