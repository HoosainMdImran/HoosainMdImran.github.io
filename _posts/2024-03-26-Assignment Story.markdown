## Introduction <br>
In this part of our research we will find the relation between hapiness and GDP. Moreover, we will find if there is any other link between hapiness score with other variable like social benifit, healthy life expectancy for find the relationship. We use the dataset of world happiness report [1].The dataset includes information from 171 different countries and is categorized into 11 distinct regions.
## Story
It's essential to recognize the elements that fundamentally contribute to happiness in a world where progress and high quality of living standards are being searched for. The complicated relationship between economic prosperity and emotional well-being is highlighted by recent research on global happiness statistics, which shows how these factors connect globally. For this reason we will dive into topic and go on some deep research about the ponit at below. Our main priority will be find some co-relation between hapiness score and the variables are doing this.

#### The Pursuit of Happiness
Our study mainly looking for some patterns of hapiness around the world, which include the data we collected from the world hapiness data that includes year 2015 to 2023. This dataset provided the yearly data of coutries' hapiness scores, along with GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, social support and so on. For now we will compare the average hapiness score with average GDP per capita for each of the countries, we will analysis whether money can buy happiness or not.

Figure 1: Top five and last five country in the ranking of world hapiest contry in the world.

In the avobe table we can see that Switzerland having the highest average GPD but it is on the number four on the list, whereas, Finland is on the top with just little bit less than that number. More or less we can see that there are some other variables that making this type of fluctuatioon in the position or in the hapiness scores. 

At the top of table, Nordic countries like Finland , Denmark and Iceland consistently outline others, because of their best economic performance with high hapiness score. However, there are other countries like Switzerland where GDP per capita is highest among these 5 but they came in the number four because of other factors like comprehensive welfare systems, low corruption levels, and effective social support structures.
Now we will look deep down other relations with the other variables with the hapiness score.

Figure 2: Linear dependencies between Hapiness score vs variables like gdp per capita, perception of corruption, social support, healthy life expectency, generosity. 

As we can see like GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expentency and fredom to make life choices have linear dependencies with hapiness score, whereas, we can also say that there are also some outlairs who do not go with this speach. But more or less there are also some of the outlairs they are not following this trend. So there are also some of the factors are unseen in this part of the topic.

The chart shows two trends in crime over a typical day in the city from 2010 to 2017. Assaults are less frequent than weapon law violations, and both types of crime are least likely to occur in the early morning, around 4 to 6 AM. As the day progresses, the examples of both crimes grow, with a significant wave in weapon-related crimes beginning late in the morning. The peak for assault and weapon law violations happens in the evening, between 6 PM and 9 PM. After this peak, the crimes gradually decrease as the night progresses. We can see a clear connection between 'Weapon Law' and 'Assult' related crimes.

This data can provide insights into the times of day most prone to criminal activities and may help law enforcement in crime prevention and resource allocation.

>We speculate that the weapons law in the USA has to be reformed to ensure a significant decrease in crimes related to firearms and assault. The number of weapons sold in the USA has increased rapidly.[2]
